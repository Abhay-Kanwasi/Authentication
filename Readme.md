# Project Overview

A comprehensive authentication system using Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Passport.js.


## Introduction to the Stack
The foundation of this project lies in a powerful tech stack:

`MongoDB`: A versatile NoSQL database for storing user credentials, profiles, and session information.

`Express.js`: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, perfect for building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.

`Next.js`: A React framework renowned for its server-side rendering, static site generation, and seamless developer experience.

`Passport.js`: An authentication middleware for Node.js, offering a plethora of authentication strategies and streamlined integration with frameworks like Express.js.


## Key Features
This authentication system encompasses a plethora of features to cater to diverse user requirements:

`Register`: Users can effortlessly create accounts by providing essential details such as username, email, and password.

`Email Verification`: To ensure the validity of user accounts, an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent via email for email verification.

`Login`: Authenticated users can securely log in using their credentials, with sessions managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

`Password Reset`: Users can request a password reset link via email in case they forget their passwords.

`Reset Password`: Upon receiving the password reset link, users can set a new password to regain access to their accounts.

`Profile Management`: Users have the flexibility to update their profiles, including details such as username, email, and profile picture.

`Change Password`: For enhanced security, users can change their passwords at any time through a straightforward process.

`Logout`: Terminates the user's session and revokes access tokens, ensuring seamless security management.
